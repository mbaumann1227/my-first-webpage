  <h2>A List of Inspiring Quotes From Some of The Greatest Minds of Our World</h2>
  <p>Here is a list a few of my favorite meditations. Hope they inspire you as much as they do me!</p>
  <p><i>"We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live; they travel far."</i> <b>Swami Vivekananda</b></p>
  <p><i>"Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one."</i> <b>Marcus Aurelius</b></p>
  <p><i>"Difficulties Strengthen the mind, as labor does the body"</i> <b>Lucius Annaeus Seneca</b></p>
  <p><i>"The sign of intelligence is that you are constantly wondering. Idiots are always sure about every damn thing they are doing in their life."</i> <b>Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev</b></p>
  <p><i>"Don't just say you have read books. Show that through them you have learned to think better, to be a more discriminating and reflective person."</i> <b>Epictetus</b></p>
  <p><i>"Do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it. Do not believe in anything simply because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything simply because it is found written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it."</i> <b>Buddha Siddhartha Gautama Shakyamuni</b></p>
